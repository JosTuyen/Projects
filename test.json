Partition functions can be computed to derive base pair probabilities and stochastic samples of foldings or hybridizations. Energy minimization methods compute minimum free energy foldings or hybridizations, and can also compute suboptimal foldings that mimic the performance of the famous mfold software.\n\nFor melting simulations, the package computes not just melting temperatures, but entire melting profiles. UV absorbance at 260 nm, heat capacity change (Cp), and mole fractions of different molecular species are computed as a function of temperature.

We have developed a read length-independent method for taxonomic profiling and we provide a freely available Matlab/Octave toolbox which includes an ultra-fast implementation of that method. Besides the platform-independent toolbox we also provide a prototype tool implementation for Windows that allows the user to compare a large number of preprocessed metagenomes within a graphical environment.Our tests indicate that Taxy results compare well with taxonomic profiles obtained with other methods. However, in contrast to the existing methods, Taxy provides a nearly constant profiling accuracy across all kinds of read lengths and it operates at an unrivaled speed. As input, DNA sequences in terms of multi-FASTA files of any size can be used for the estimation of metagenomic profiles. The analysis of a large sequence file with a Gbp volume typically requires less than a minute of processing time and can even be performed on a standard notebook.

Each sequence in each set is divided into the same number of multiple intervals n such that n = 2^k, where k is a positive integer and  k >= 1. Thus, n could be any value of the set {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, ...}. k represents the number of scales.\n\nThe program has two input files obtained as follows:\n\nFor a given set of features, say motifs, the user counts the number of occurrences of each feature in each interval of each sequence in S1 and S1, and builds two tabular files representing the count results in each interval of S1 and S1. These are the input files of the program. \n\nThe program gives two output files:\n\n- The first output file is a TABULAR format file representing the second moments, p-values, and test orientations for each feature at each scale.\n- The second output file is a PDF file consisting of as many figures as the number of features, such that each figure represents the values of the second moment for that feature at every scale.\n\n-----\n\n.. class:: warningmark\n\n**Note**\n\nIn order to obtain empirical p-values, a random perumtation test is implemented by the program, which results in the fact that the program gives slightly different results each time it is run on the same input file. \n\n-----\n\n**Example**\n\nCounting the occurrences of 5 features (motifs) in 16 intervals (one line per interval) of the DNA sequences in S1 gives the following tabular file::\n\n\tdeletionHoptspot\tinsertionHoptspot\tdnaPolPauseFrameshift\ttopoisomeraseCleavageSite\ttranslinTarget\t\n\t\t226\t\t\t403\t\t\t416\t\t\t221\t\t\t\t1165\n\t\t236\t\t\t444\t\t\t380\t\t\t241\t\t\t\t1223\n\t\t242\t\t\t496\t\t\t391\t\t\t195\t\t\t\t1116\n\t\t243\t\t\t429\t\t\t364\t\t\t191\t\t\t\t1118\n\t\t244\t\t\t410\t\t\t371\t\t\t236\t\t\t\t1063\n\t\t230\t\t\t386\t\t\t370\t\t\t217\t\t\t\t1087\n\t\t275\t\t\t404\t\t\t402\t\t\t214\t\t\t\t1044\n\t\t265\t\t\t443\t\t\t365\t\t\t231\t\t\t\t1086\n\t\t255\t\t\t390\t\t\t354\t\t\t246\t\t\t\t1114\n\t\t281\t\t\t384\t\t\t406\t\t\t232\t\t\t\t1102\n\t\t263\t\t\t459\t\t\t369\t\t\t251\t\t\t\t1135\n\t\t280\t\t\t433\t\t\t400\t\t\t251\t\t\t\t1159\n\t\t278\t\t\t385\t\t\t382\t\t\t231\t\t\t\t1147\n\t\t248\t\t\t393\t\t\t389\t\t\t211\t\t\t\t1162\n\t\t251\t\t\t403\t\t\t385\t\t\t246\t\t\t\t1114\n\t\t239\t\t\t383\t\t\t347\t\t\t227\t\t\t\t1172\n\nAnd counting the occurrences of 5 features (motifs) in 16 intervals (one line per interval) of the DNA sequences in S2 gives the following tabular file:: \n\n\tdeletionHoptspot\tinsertionHoptspot\tdnaPolPauseFrameshift\ttopoisomeraseCleavageSite\ttranslinTarget\n\t\t235\t\t\t374\t\t\t407\t\t\t257\t\t\t\t1159\n\t\t244\t\t\t356\t\t\t353\t\t\t212\t\t\t\t1128\n\t\t233\t\t\t343\t\t\t322\t\t\t204\t\t\t\t1110\n\t\t222\t\t\t329\t\t\t398\t\t\t253\t\t\t\t1054\n\t\t216\t\t\t325\t\t\t328\t\t\t253\t\t\t\t1129\n\t\t257\t\t\t368\t\t\t352\t\t\t221\t\t\t\t1115\n\t\t238\t\t\t360\t\t\t346\t\t\t224\t\t\t\t1102\n\t\t225\t\t\t350\t\t\t377\t\t\t248\t\t\t\t1107\n\t\t230\t\t\t330\t\t\t365\t\t\t236\t\t\t\t1132\n\t\t241\t\t\t389\t\t\t357\t\t\t220\t\t\t\t1120\n\t\t274\t\t\t354\t\t\t392\t\t\t235\t\t\t\t1120\n\t\t250\t\t\t379\t\t\t354\t\t\t210\t\t\t\t1102\n\t\t254\t\t\t329\t\t\t320\t\t\t251\t\t\t\t1080\n\t\t221\t\t\t355\t\t\t406\t\t\t279\t\t\t\t1127\n\t\t224\t\t\t330\t\t\t390\t\t\t249\t\t\t\t1129\n\t\t246\t\t\t366\t\t\t364\t\t\t218\t\t\t\t1176\n\n  \nWe notice that the number of scales here is 4 because 16 = 2^4.

'\n\nCREST uses pieces of DNA called soft clips to find structural variations.  Soft clips are the DNA segments produced during sequencing that fail to properly align to the reference genome as the sample genome is reassembled.  CREST uses the soft clips to precisely identify sites of chromosomal rearrangement or where pieces of DNA are inserted or deleted.\n\nPlease cite the following article:\n\nWang J, Mullighan CG, Easton J, Roberts S, Heatley SL, Ma J, Rusch MC, Chen K, Harris CC, Ding L, Holmfeldt L, Payne-Turner D, Fan X, Wei L, Zhao D, Obenauer JC, Naeve C, Mardis ER, Wilson RK, Downing JR and Zhang J.

If\nthey do not, you will not get any results.  \n\nCREST uses soft-clipping signatures to identify breakpoints.  Soft-clipping is\nindicated by \"S\" elements in the CIGAR for SAM/BAM records.  Soft-clipping may\nnot occur, depending on the mapping algorithm and parameters and sometimes even\nthe library preparation.\n\nWith bwa sampe:\n\nOne mapping method that will soft-clip reads is bwa sampe (BWA for paired-end\nreads).  When BWA successfully maps one read in a pair but is not able to map\nthe other, it will attempt a more permissive Smith-Waterman alignment of the\nunmapped read in the neighborhood of the mapped mate.  If it is only able to\nalign part of the read, then it will soft-clip the portion on the end that it\ncould not align.  Often this occurs at the breakpoints of structural\nvariations.\n\nIn some cases when the insert sizes approach the read length, BWA will not\nperform Smith-Waterman alignment.  Reads from inserts smaller than the read\nlength will contain primer and/or adapter and will often not map.  When the\ninsert size is close to the read length, this creates a skewed distribution\nof inferred insert sizes which may cause BWA to not attempt Smith-Waterman\nrealignment.  This is indicated by the error message \"weird pairing\".  Often\nin these cases there are also unusually low mapping rates.\n\nOne way to fix this problem is to remap unmapped reads bwasw.

Our testing has shown that when Titanium data are trimmed to 450 flows using trim.flows, shhh.flows provides the highest quality data for any other method available. In contrast, when we use the min/max number of flows suggested by Quince of 360/720, the error rate is not that great. This much improved error rate does come at a computational cost. Whereas the features in trim.seqs take on the order of minutes, shhh.flows can take on the order of hours.

Tandem Repeats Finder is a program to locate and display tandem repeats in DNA sequences. In order to use the program, the user submits a sequence in FASTA format. There is no need to specify the pattern, the size of the pattern or any other parameter. The output consists of two files: a repeat table file and an alignment file. The repeat table contains information about each repeat, including its location, size, number of copies and nucleotide content. Clicking on the location indices for one of the table entries opens a second web browser that shows an alignment of the copies against a consensus pattern. The program is very fast, analyzing sequences on the order of .5Mb in just a few seconds. Submitted sequences may be of arbitrary length. Repeats with pattern size in the range from 1 to 2000 bases are detected.\n\n-------\n\n**Input format**\n\nThe FASTA format is a plain text format which looks something like this:\n\n>myseq\nAGTCGTCGCT AGCTAGCTAG CATCGAGTCT TTTCGATCGA GGACTAGACT TCTAGCTAGC TAGCATAGCA TACGAGCATA TCGGTCATGA GACTGATTGG GCTTTAGCTA GCTAGCATAG CATACGAGCA TATCGGTAGA CTGATTGGGT TTAGGTTACC\n\nThe first line starts with a greater than sign \">\" and contains a name or other identifier for the sequence. This is the sequence header and must be in a single line. The remaining lines contain the sequence data. The sequence can be in upper or lower case letters. Anything other than letters (numbers for example) is ignored. Multiple sequences can be present in the same file as long as each sequence has its own header.\n\n-------\n\n**Output format**\n\nTable Explanation:\n\nThe summary table includes the following information::\n\n 1 Indices of the repeat relative to the start of the sequence.\n 2 Period size of the repeat.\n 3 Number of copies aligned with the consensus pattern.\n 4 Size of consensus pattern (may differ slightly from the period size).\n 5 Percent of matches between adjacent copies overall.\n 6 Percent of indels between adjacent copies overall.\n 7 Alignment score.\n 8 Percent composition for each of the four nucleotides.\n 9 Entropy measure based on percent composition.\n\nIf the output contains more than 120 repeats, multiple linked tables are produced. The links to the other tables appear at the top and bottom of each table.\n\nNote: If you save multiple linked summary table files, use the default names supplied by your browser to preserve the automatic linking.\n\nAlignment Explanation:\n\nThe alignment is presented as follows::\n\n 1 In each pair of lines, the actual sequence is on the top and a consensus sequence for all the copies is on the bottom.\n 2 Each pair of lines is one period except for very small patterns.\n 3 The 10 sequence characters before and after a repeat are shown.\n 4 Symbol * indicates a mismatch.\n 5 Symbol - indicates an insertion or deletion.\n 6 Statistics refers to the matches, mismatches and indels overall between adjacent copies in the sequence, not between the sequence and the consensus pattern.\n 7 Distances between matching characters at corresponding positions are listed as distance, number at that distance, percentage of all matches.\n 8 ACGTcount is percentage of each nucleotide in the repeat sequence.\n 9 Consensus sequence is shown by itself.\n 10 If chosen as an option, 500 characters of flanking sequence on each side of the repeat are shown.\n\nNote: If you save the alignment file, use the default name supplied by your browser to preserve the automatic cross-referencing with the summary table.\n\nThe data file is a text file which contains the same information, in the same order, as the repeat table file, plus consensus and repeat sequences. This file contains no labeling and is suitable for additional processing, for example with a perl script, outside of the program.\n\n\n-------\n\n**References**\n\nIf you use this Galaxy tool in work leading to a scientific publication please\ncite the following papers:\n\nG.

In addition to using one\nglobal GFM index that represents the general population, HISAT2 uses a large set\nof small GFM indexes that collectively cover the whole genome (each index\nrepresenting a genomic region of 56 Kbp, with 55,000 indexes needed to cover\nthe human population). These small indexes (called local indexes), combined\nwith several alignment strategies, enable rapid and accurate alignment of\nsequencing reads. This new indexing scheme is called a Hierarchical Graph\nFM index (HGFM).  In addition to spliced alignment, HISAT handles reads\ninvolving indels and supports a paired-end alignment mode. Multiple processors\ncan be used simultaneously to achieve greater alignment speed. HISAT outputs\nalignments in `SAM <http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAM1.pdf>`__ format, enabling\ninteroperation with a large number of other tools (e.g. `SAMtools <http://samtools.sourceforge.net>`__,\n`GATK <http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsa/wiki/index.php/The_Genome_Analysis_Toolkit>`__)\nthat use SAM.

Barrnap now supports Archaea, Eukaryota and Mitochondria. It takes FASTA DNA sequence as input, and write GFF3 as output. It uses the new NHMMER tool that comes with HMMER 3.1-dev for HMM searching in DNA:DNA style. NHMMER binaries for 64-bit Linux and Mac OS X are included and will be auto-detected. Multithreading is supported and one can expect roughly linear speed-ups with more CPUs.\nThis tool is designed to be a substitute for RNAmmer. It was motivated by my desire to remove Prokka's dependency on RNAmmer which is encumbered by an free-for-academic sign-up license, and by the needed legacy HMMER 2.x which conflicts with HMMER 3.x that most people are using now.\n\nRNAmmer is more sophisticated than Barrnap, and more accurate. because it uses HMMER 2.x in glocal alignment mode, whereas HMMER 3.x currently only supports local alignment (Sean Eddy expects glocal to be supported in 2014). In practice, Barrnap will find all the typical 5/16/23S genes in bacteria, but may get the end points out by a few bases and will probably miss wierd rRNAs. The HMM models it uses are derived from RFAM, Silva, and GreenGenes.\n\nThe name Barrnap is derived from BActerial Ribosomal RNA Predictor.

GFF lines have nine tab-separated fields:\n\n1. seqname - Must be a chromosome or scaffold.\n2. source - The program that generated this feature.\n3. feature - The name of this type of feature. Some examples of standard feature types are \"CDS\", \"start_codon\", \"stop_codon\", and \"exon\".\n4. start - The starting position of the feature in the sequence. The first base is numbered 1.\n5. end - The ending position of the feature (inclusive).\n6. score - A score or signal. If there is no score value, enter \".\".\n7. strand - Valid entries include '+', '-', or '.' (for don't know/care).\n8. frame - If the feature is a coding exon, frame should be a number between 0-2 that represents the reading frame of the first base. If the feature is not a coding exon, the value should be '.'.\n9. group - All lines with the same group are linked together into a single item.\n\n--------\n\n\n**Example**\n\n\nNimblegen gives you back a GFF file with the coordinates of each probe and the normalized signal value --> log2(Cy5/Cy3) on the sixth column.\n\n\nClick here_ to download a GFF file example.\n\n.. _here: /static/example_file/GFF_file_norm.txt.zip\t\n\nThe following data in GFF format::\n\n    chr19  Nimblegen  tiling_array  100000  1000051  -1.2\t +   .  probe_name\n    chr19  Nimblegen  tiling_array  100100  1000151   2.9\t +   .  probe_name\n    \nwill be converted to WIG as shown below (Please note that a header will be added to the file)::\n\n    track type=wiggle_0 name=\"Analysis name\" description=\"raw_data ratio\" visibility=full autoscale=off maxHeightPixels=100:50:20 color=200,100,0 altColor=0,100,200\n    chr19   1000000  1000050   -1.2\n    chr19   1000100  1000150    2.9\n\n.. class:: infomark\n\n\"Analysis name\" will be shown in the UCSC Genome Browser as track name and can be defined by user.\n\nViusalize chip raw intensity:\n\n.. image:: static/images/CARPET/ucsc2.jpg\n\n  \n  \n  ","type":"Tool","version":"1.1.0","originLink":"N/A","directLink":"N/A","operatingSystems":[],"programmingLanguages":[],"name":"gff to bed wiggle","publisher":"matces","id":1498,"parameters":[]}},{"_index":"tools","_type":"tool","_id":"2102","_score":1.0214325,"_source":{"outputs":["tabular"],"interfaces":[],"methods":[],"inputs":["tabular","","","",""],"author":"","origin":"N/A","domains":[],"description":"\n\n**What it does**\n\nSuppose you have metagenomic samples from two different locations and have classified the reads unique to various taxa.

It takes in an input file (a tab delimited file consisting of three or more columns (taxon/category, read counts in location 1, read counts in location 2)), columns to compare, d value and a correction method 0 (Bonferroni) or 1 (FDR).\n\n-----\n\n**Example**\n\n- Input File: phylum, read count in location-1, read count in location-2::\n\n    Annelida            36     2\n    Apicomplexa         17     8\n    Arthropoda        1964   928\n    Ascomycota         436    49\n    Basidiomycota       77    55\n\n- Arguments to be supplied by the user::\n\n    col_i   col_j   d-value    correction-method\n    \n    2       3       0.44       Bonferroni\n\n- Output File: phylum, readcount1, readcount2, z1, z2, p1, p2, corrected p1, corrected p2::\n\n    Annelida            36     2   3.385   4.276  0.000356  0.000010  0.00463  0.00012\n    Apicomplexa         17     8  -0.157  -0.156  0.437707  0.438103  1.00000  1.00000\n    Arthropoda        1964   928  -1.790  -1.777  0.036755  0.037744  0.47782  0.49067\n    Ascomycota         436    49   9.778  11.418  0.000000  0.000000  0.00000  0.00000\n    Basidiomycota       77    55  -2.771  -2.659  0.002792  0.003916  0.03629  0.05091\n\n-----\n\n**Note**\n\n- Input file should be Tab delimited\n- i < j\n- d cannot be 0\n- k = Bonferroni or FDR\n\n-----\n\n**References**\n\n- Shiue, W. and Bain, L.

The best value depends on the choice of comparison matrix. The default value assumes you are using the EBLOSUM62 matrix for protein sequences, and the EDNAFULL matrix for nucleotide sequences. (Floating point number from 1.0 to 100.0)\n\n- **Gap extension penalty:** [0.5 for any sequence] The gap extension, penalty is added to the standard gap penalty for each base or residue in the gap. This is how long gaps are penalized. Usually you will expect a few long gaps rather than many short gaps, so the gap extension penalty should be lower than the gap penalty. An exception is where one or both sequences are single reads with possible sequencing errors in which case you would expect many single base gaps. You can get this result by setting the gap open penalty to zero (or very low) and using the gap extension penalty to control gap scoring. (Floating point number from 0.0 to 10.0)\n\nYou can view the original documentation here_.\n    \n    .. _here: http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/release/5.0/emboss/apps/needle.html\n\n-----\n\n**Example**\n\n- Input File::\n\n    >hg18_dna range=chrX:151073054-151073136 5'pad=0 3'pad=0 revComp=FALSE strand=? repeatMasking=none\n    TTTATGTCTATAATCCTTACCAAAAGTTACCTTGGAATAAGAAGAAGTCA\n    GTAAAAAGAAGGCTGTTGTTCCGTGAAATACTG\n\n- If both Sequence1 and Sequence2 take the above file as input, Gap open penalty equals 10.0, Gap extension penalty equals 0.5, Brief identity and similarity is set to Yes, Output Alignment File Format is set to SRS pairs, the output file is::\n\n    ########################################\n    # Program: needle\n    # Rundate: Mon Apr 02 2007 14:23:16\n    # Align_format: srspair\n    # Report_file: ./database/files/dataset_7.dat\n    ########################################\n     \n    #=======================================\n    #\n    # Aligned_sequences: 2\n    # 1: hg18_dna\n    # 2: hg18_dna\n    # Matrix: EDNAFULL\n    # Gap_penalty: 10.0\n    # Extend_penalty: 0.5\n    #\n    # Length: 83\n    # Identity:      83/83 (100.0%)\n    # Similarity:    83/83 (100.0%)\n    # Gaps:           0/83 ( 0.0%)\n    # Score: 415.0\n    #\n    #=======================================\n\n    hg18_dna           1 TTTATGTCTATAATCCTTACCAAAAGTTACCTTGGAATAAGAAGAAGTCA     50\n                       ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n    hg18_dna           1 TTTATGTCTATAATCCTTACCAAAAGTTACCTTGGAATAAGAAGAAGTCA     50\n        \n    hg18_dna          51 GTAAAAAGAAGGCTGTTGTTCCGTGAAATACTG     83\n                       |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n    hg18_dna          51 GTAAAAAGAAGGCTGTTGTTCCGTGAAATACTG     83\n        \n    #---------------------------------------\n    #---------------------------------------\n\n\n------\n\n**Citation**\n\nFor the underlying tool, please cite `Rice P, Longden I, Bleasby A.

(The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0.)\n    3. chromEnd - The ending position in the chromosome, plus 1 (i.e., a half-open interval).\n\nThe additional BED fields (optional) are::\n\n    4. name - The name of the BED line.\n    5. score - A score between 0 and 1000.\n    6. strand - Defines the strand - either '+' or '-'.\n    7. thickStart - The starting position where the feature is drawn thickly at the Genome Browser.\n    8. thickEnd - The ending position where the feature is drawn thickly at the Genome Browser.\n    9. reserved - This should always be set to zero.\n   10. blockCount - The number of blocks (exons) in the BED line.\n   11. blockSizes - A comma-separated list of the block sizes. The number of items in this list should correspond to blockCount.\n   12. blockStarts - A comma-separated list of block starts. All of the blockStart positions should be calculated relative to chromStart. The number of items in this list should correspond to blockCount.\n\n**GFF format** General Feature Format is a format for describing genes and other features associated with DNA, RNA and Protein sequences.

GFF lines have nine tab-separated fields::\n\n    1. seqid - Must be a chromosome or scaffold.\n    2. source - The program that generated this feature.\n    3. type - The name of this type of feature. Some examples of standard feature types are \"gene\", \"CDS\", \"protein\", \"mRNA\", and \"exon\". \n    4. start - The starting position of the feature in the sequence. The first base is numbered 1.\n    5. stop - The ending position of the feature (inclusive).\n    6. score - A score between 0 and 1000. If there is no score value, enter \".\".\n    7. strand - Valid entries include '+', '-', or '.' (for don't know/care).\n    8. phase - If the feature is a coding exon, frame should be a number between 0-2 that represents the reading frame of the first base. If the feature is not a coding exon, the value should be '.'.\n    9. attributes - All lines with the same group are linked together into a single item.\n\n**GTF format** Gene Transfer Format, it borrows from GFF, but has additional structure that warrants a separate definition and format name. GTF lines have nine tab-seaparated fields::\n\n    1. seqname - The name of the sequence.\n    2. source - This indicating where the annotation came from.\n    3. feature - The name of the feature types. The following feature types are required: 'CDS', 'start_codon' and 'stop_codon'\n    4. start - The starting position of the feature in the sequence. The first base is numbered 1.\n    5. end - The ending position of the feature (inclusive).\n    6. score - The score field indicates a degree of confidence in the feature's existence and coordinates.\n    7. strand - Valid entries include '+', '-', or '.'\n    8. frame - If the feature is a coding exon, frame should be a number between 0-2 that represents the reading frame of the first base.\n    9. attributes - These attributes are designed for handling multiple transcripts from the same genomic region.\n\n--------\n\n**Copyright**\n\nGFF-to-GTF Wrapper Version 0.6 (Apr 2015)\n\n2009-2015 Max Planck Society, University of TÃ¼bingen & Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center\n\n\t","type":"Tool","version":"2.1.0","originLink":"N/A","directLink":"N/A","operatingSystems":[],"programmingLanguages":[],"name":"fml_gff2gtf","publisher":"vipints","id":2912,"parameters":[]}},{"_index":"tools","_type":"tool","_id":"1222","_score":0.6976285,"_source":{"outputs":["sam","fastq","fastq","fastq","fastq"],"interfaces":[],"methods":[],"inputs":["","",""],"author":"","origin":"N/A","domains":[],"description":"\n\n**What it does**\n\nBowtie_ is a short read aligner designed to be ultrafast and memory-efficient.

Genome Biology 10:R25.\n\n.. _Bowtie: http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml\n\n------\n\n**Know what you are doing**\n\n.. class:: warningmark\n\nThere is no such thing (yet) as an automated gearshift in short read mapping. It is all like stick-shift driving in San Francisco. In other words = running this tool with default parameters will probably not give you meaningful results. A way to deal with this is to **understand** the parameters by carefully reading the `documentation`__ and experimenting. Fortunately, Galaxy makes experimenting easy.\n\n .. __: http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml\n\n------\n\n**Input formats**\n\nBowtie accepts files in Sanger FASTQ format. Use the FASTQ Groomer to prepare your files.\n\n------\n\n**A Note on Built-in Reference Genomes**\n\nThe default variant for all genomes is \"Full\", defined as all primary chromosomes (or scaffolds/contigs) including mitochondrial plus associated unmapped, plasmid, and other segments. When only one version of a genome is available in this tool, it represents the default \"Full\" variant. Some genomes will have more than one variant available. The \"Canonical Male\" or sometimes simply \"Canonical\" variant contains the primary chromosomes for a genome. For example a human \"Canonical\" variant contains chr1-chr22, chrX, chrY, and chrM. The \"Canonical Female\" variant contains the primary chromosomes excluding chrY.\n\n------\n\n**Outputs**\n\nThe output is in SAM format, and has the following columns::\n\n    Column  Description\n  --------  --------------------------------------------------------   \n   1 QNAME  Query (pair) NAME\n   2 FLAG   bitwise FLAG\n   3 RNAME  Reference sequence NAME\n   4 POS    1-based leftmost POSition/coordinate of clipped sequence\n   5 MAPQ   MAPping Quality (Phred-scaled)\n   6 CIGAR  extended CIGAR string\n   7 MRNM   Mate Reference sequence NaMe ('=' if same as RNAME)\n   8 MPOS   1-based Mate POSition\n   9 ISIZE  Inferred insert SIZE\n  10 SEQ    query SEQuence on the same strand as the reference\n  11 QUAL   query QUALity (ASCII-33 gives the Phred base quality)\n  12 OPT    variable OPTional fields in the format TAG:VTYPE:VALUE\n  \nThe flags are as follows::\n\n    Flag  Description\n  ------  -------------------------------------\n  0x0001  the read is paired in sequencing\n  0x0002  the read is mapped in a proper pair\n  0x0004  the query sequence itself is unmapped\n  0x0008  the mate is unmapped\n  0x0010  strand of the query (1 for reverse)\n  0x0020  strand of the mate\n  0x0040  the read is the first read in a pair\n  0x0080  the read is the second read in a pair\n  0x0100  the alignment is not primary\n\nIt looks like this (scroll sideways to see the entire example)::\n\n  QNAME\tFLAG\tRNAME\tPOS\tMAPQ\tCIAGR\tMRNM\tMPOS\tISIZE\tSEQ\tQUAL\tOPT\n  HWI-EAS91_1_30788AAXX:1:1:1761:343\t4\t*\t0\t0\t*\t*\t0\t0\tAAAAAAANNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACNNANNGAGTNGNNNNNNNGCTTCCCACAGNNCTGG\thhhhhhh;;hhhhhhhhhhh^hOhhhhghhhfhhhgh;;h;;hhhh;h;;;;;;;hhhhhhghhhh;;Phhh\n  HWI-EAS91_1_30788AAXX:1:1:1578:331\t4\t*\t0\t0\t*\t*\t0\t0\tGTATAGANNAATAAGAAAAAAAAAAATGAAGACTTTCNNANNTCTGNANNNNNNNTCTTTTTTCAGNNGTAG\thhhhhhh;;hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh;;h;;hhhh;h;;;;;;;hhhhhhhhhhh;;hhVh\n\n-------\n\n**Bowtie settings**\n\nAll of the options have a default value. You can change any of them. Most of the options in Bowtie have been implemented here.\n\n------\n\n**Bowtie parameter list**\n\nThis is an exhaustive list of Bowtie options:\n\nFor indexing (bowtie-build)::\n\n  -a                 No auto behavior. Disable the default behavior where bowtie automatically \n                     selects values for --bmax/--bmaxdivn/--dcv/--packed parameters according \n                     to the memory available. [off]\n  --packed           Packing. Use a packed representation for DNA strings. [auto] \n  --bmax INT         Suffix maximum. The maximum number of suffixes allowed in a block. [auto]\n  --bmaxdivn INT     Suffix maximum fraction. The maximum number of suffixes allowed in a block \n                     expressed as a fraction of the length of the reference. [4]\n  --dcv INT          Difference-cover sample. Use INT as the period for the difference-cover \n                     sample. [1024]\n  --nodc INT         No difference-cover sample. Disable the difference-cover sample. [off]\n  -r                 No reference indexes. Do not build the NAME.3.ebwt and NAME.4.ebwt portions \n                     of the index. Used only for paired-end alignment. [off]\n  -o                 Offrate. How many Burrows-Wheeler rows get marked by the indexer. The \n                     indexer will mark every 2^INT rows. The marked rows correspond to rows on \n                     the genome. [5]\n  -t INT             Ftab. The lookup table used to calculate an initial Burrows-Wheeler range \n                     with respect to the first INT characters of the query. Ftab is 4^INT+1 \n                     bytes. [10]\n  --ntoa             N conversion. Convert Ns to As before building the index. Otherwise, Ns are \n                     simply excluded from the index and Bowtie will not find alignments that \n                     overlap them. [off]\n  --big              Endianness. Endianness to use when serializing integers to the index file. [off]\n  --little           Endianness. [--little]\n  --seed INT         Random seed. Use INT as the seed for the pseudo-random number generator. [off]\n  --cutoff INT       Cutoff. Index only the first INT bases of the reference sequences (cumulative \n                     across sequences) and ignore the rest. [off]\n\nFor aligning (bowtie)::\n\n  -s INT             Skip. Do not align the first INT reads or pairs in the input. [off]\n  -u INT             Align limit. Only align the first INT reads/pairs from the input. [no limit]\n  -5 INT             High-quality trim. Trim INT bases from the high-quality (left) end of each \n                     read before alignment. [0]\n  -3 INT             Low-quality trim. Trim INT bases from the low-quality (right) end of each \n                     read before alignment. [0]\n  -n INT             Mismatch seed. Maximum number of mismatches permitted in the seed (defined \n                     with seed length option). Can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. [2]\n  -e INT             Mismatch quality. Maximum permitted total of quality values at mismatched \n                     read positions. Bowtie rounds quality values to the nearest 10 and saturates \n                     at 30. [70]\n  -l INT             Seed length. The number of bases on the high-quality end of the read to \n                     which the -n ceiling applies. Must be at least 5. [28]\n  --nomaqround       Suppress MAQ rounding. Values are internally rounded to the nearest 10 and \n                     saturate at 30. This options turns off that rounding. [off] \n  -v INT             MAQ- or SOAP-like alignment policy. This option turns off the default \n                     MAQ-like alignment policy in favor of a SOAP-like one. End-to-end alignments \n                     with at most INT mismatches. [off]\n  -I INT             Minimum insert. The minimum insert size for valid paired-end alignments. \n                     Does checking on untrimmed reads if -5 or -3 is used. [0]\n  -X INT             Maximum insert. The maximum insert size for valid paired-end alignments. \n                     Does checking on untrimmed reads if -5 or -3 is used. [250]\n  --fr               Mate orientation. The upstream/downstream mate orientations for a valid \n                     paired-end alignment against the forward reference strand. [--fr]\n  --rf               Mate orientation. [off]\n  --ff               Mate orientation. [off]\n  --pairtries INT    Maximum alignment attempts for paired-end data. [100] \n  --nofw             No forward aligning. Choosing this option means that Bowtie will not attempt \n                     to align against the forward reference strand. [off]\n  --norc             No reverse-complement aligning. Setting this will mean that Bowtie will not \n                     attempt to align against the reverse-complement reference strand. [off]\n  --un FILENAME      Write all reads that could not be aligned to file [off]\n  --max FILENAME     Write all reads with a number of valid alignments exceeding the limit\n                     set with the -m option to file [off]\n  --maxbts INT       Maximum backtracks. The maximum number of backtracks permitted when aligning \n                     a read in -n 2 or -n 3 mode. [125 without --best] [800 with --best]\n  -y                 Try hard. Try as hard as possible to find valid alignments when they exist, \n                     including paired-end alignments. [off]\n  --chunkmbs INT     Thread memory. The number of megabytes of memory a given thread is given to \n                     store path descriptors in --best mode. [32]\n  -k INT             Valid alignments. The number of valid alignments per read or pair. [off] \n  -a                 All valid alignments. Choosing this means that all valid alignments per read \n                     or pair will be reported. [off]\n  -m INT             Suppress alignments. Suppress all alignments for a particular read or pair \n                     if more than INT reportable alignments exist for it. [no limit]\n  --best             Best mode. Make Bowtie guarantee that reported singleton alignments are \n                     \"best\" in terms of stratum (the number of mismatches) and quality values at \n                     mismatched position. [off]\n  --strata           Best strata. When running in best mode, report alignments that fall into the \n                     best stratum if there are ones falling into more than one. [off]\n  -o INT             Offrate override. Override the offrate of the index with INT. Some row \n                     markings are discarded when index read into memory. INT must be greater than \n                     the value used to build the index (default: 5). [off]\n  --seed INT         Random seed. Use INT as the seed for the pseudo-random number generator. [off]\n  --snpphred INT     Use INT as the SNP penalty for decoding colorspace alignments. True ratio of \n                     SNPs per base in the subject genome. [see --snpfrac]\n  --snpfrac DEC      Use DEC as the estimated ratio of SNPs per base when decoding colorspace \n                     alignments. [0.001]\n  --col-keepends     Keep the extreme-end nucleotides and qualities when decoding colorspace \n                     alignments.

GFF3 lines have nine tab-separated fields:\n\n    1. seqid - Must be a chromosome or scaffold.\n    2. source - The program that generated this feature.\n    3. type - The name of this type of feature. Some examples of standard feature types are \"gene\", \"CDS\", \"protein\", \"mRNA\", and \"exon\". \n    4. start - The starting position of the feature in the sequence. The first base is numbered 1.\n    5. stop - The ending position of the feature (inclusive).\n    6. score - A score between 0 and 1000. If there is no score value, enter \".\".\n    7. strand - Valid entries include '+', '-', or '.' (for don't know/care).\n    8. phase - If the feature is a coding exon, frame should be a number between 0-2 that represents the reading frame of the first base. If the feature is not a coding exon, the value should be '.'.\n    9. attributes - All lines with the same group are linked together into a single item.\n\n--------\n\nThis tool is a part of the **MLB Group at Friedrich Miescher Laboratory of the Max Planck Society**.

This is usually necessary when the read length of the\nmachine is longer than the molecule that is sequenced, such as in\nmicroRNA data.\n\nThe tool is based on the opensource `cutadapt \n<http://code.google.com/p/cutadapt/>`_ tool. See the `complete cutadapt\ndocumentation <https://cutadapt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ for additional details.\n\n-----\n\nAlgorithm\n---------\n\ncutadapt uses a simple semi-global alignment algorithm, without any special optimizations.\nFor speed, the algorithm is implemented as a Python extension module in ``calignmodule.c``.\n\n\nPartial adapter matches\n-----------------------\n\nCutadapt correctly deals with partial adapter matches. As an example, suppose\nyour adapter sequence is ``ADAPTER`` (specified via 3' Adapters parameter).\nIf you have these input sequences::\n\n    MYSEQUENCEADAPTER\n    MYSEQUENCEADAP\n    MYSEQUENCEADAPTERSOMETHINGELSE\n\nAll of them will be trimmed to ``MYSEQUENCE``. If the sequence starts with an\nadapter, like this::\n\n    ADAPTERSOMETHING\n\nIt will be empty after trimming.\n\nWhen the allowed error rate is sufficiently high, errors in\nthe adapter sequence are allowed. For example, ``ADABTER`` (1 mismatch), ``ADAPTR`` (1 deletion),\nand ``ADAPPTER`` (1 insertion) will all be recognized if the error rate is set to 0.15.\n\n\nAnchoring 5' adapters\n---------------------\n\nIf you specify a 5' (Front) adapter, the adapter may overlap the beginning of the read or\noccur anywhere whithin it. If it appears withing the read, the sequence that precedes it\nwill also be trimmed in addition to the adapter. For example when the adapter sequence is\n``ADAPTER``::\n\n    HELLOADAPTERTHERE\n    APTERTHERE\n\nwill both be trimmed to ``THERE``. To avoid this, you can prefix the adapter with the character\n``^``. This will restrict the search, forcing the adapter to be a prefix of the read. With\nthe adapter sequence set to ``^ADAPTER``, only reads like this will be trimmed::\n\n    ADAPTERHELLO\n\n\nAllowing adapters anywhere\n--------------------------\n\nCutadapt assumes that any adapter specified via the 3' Adapter parameter\nwas ligated to the 3\\' end of the sequence. This is the correct assumption for\nat least the SOLiD and Illumina small RNA protocols and probably others.\nThe assumption is enforced by the alignment algorithm, which only finds the adapter\nwhen its starting position is within the read. In other words, the 5' base of\nthe adapter must appear within the read. The adapter and all bases following\nit are removed.\n\nIf, on the other hand, your adapter can also be ligated to the 5' end (on\npurpose or by accident), you should tell cutadapt so by using the Anywhere Adapter\nparameter. It will then use a slightly different alignment algorithm\n(so-called semiglobal alignment), which allows any type of overlap between the\nadapter and the sequence. In particular, the adapter may appear only partially\nin the beginning of the read, like this::\n\n    PTERMYSEQUENCE\n\nThe decision which part of the read to remove is made as follows: If there is at\nleast one base before the found adapter, then the adapter is considered to be\na 3' adapter and the adapter itself and everything following it is removed.\nOtherwise, the adapter is considered to be a 5' adapter and it is removed from\nthe read.\n\nHere are some examples, which may make this clearer (left: read, right: trimmed\nread)::\n\n    MYSEQUENCEADAPTER -> MYSEQUENCE (3' adapter)\n    MADAPTER -> M (3' adapter)\n    ADAPTERMYSEQUENCE -> MYSEQUENCE (5' adapter)\n    PTERMYSEQUENCE -> MYSEQUENCE (5' adapter)\n\nThe regular algorithm (3' Adapter) would trim the first two examples in the same way,\nbut trim the third to an empty sequence and trim the fourth not at all.\n\n\nFormat of the info file\n-----------------------\nThe info file contains information about the found adapters. The output is a tab-separated text file. Each line corresponds to one read of the input file. The fields are:\n\n1. Read name\n2. Number of errors\n3. 0-based start coordinate of the adapter match\n4. 0-based end coordinate of the adapter match\n5. Sequence of the read to the left of the adapter match (can be empty)\n6. Sequence of the read that was matched to the adapter\n7. Sequence of the read to the right of the adapter match (can be empty)\n8. Name of the found adapter.\n\nThe concatenation of the fields 5-7 yields the full read sequence. In column 8, adapters without a name are numbered starting from 1.\n\nIf no adapter was found, the format is as follows:\n\n1. Read name\n2. The value -1\n3. The read sequence\n\nWhen parsing that file, be aware that additional columns may be added in the future. Note also that some fields can be empty, resulting in consecutive tabs within a line. Also, in the current version, when the *Match times* option is set to a value other than 1 (the default value), multiple lines are written to the info file for each read.\n\n.. _cutadapt: http://code.google.com/p/cutadapt/\n    ","type":"Tool","version":"1.6","originLink":"N/A","directLink":"N/A","operatingSystems":[],"programmingLanguages":[],"name":"cutadapt","publisher":"lparsons","id":897,"parameters":[]}},{"_index":"tools","_type":"tool","_id":"1852","_score":0.5967083,"_source":{"outputs":["tabular"],"interfaces":[],"methods":[],"inputs":["","","","","",""],"author":"","origin":"N/A","domains":[],"description":"\n\n**What it does**\n\nCSEM (ChIP-Seq multi-read allocation using E-M algorithm) is a multi-read allocation algorithm. *Multi-reads* are the reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome. Most common analysis of ChIP-seq data relies on using only reads that map uniquely to relevant reference genome (*uni-reads*). This can lead to the omission of up to 30 % of alignable reads. Chung et al. (2011) illustrated that incorporation of multi-reads significantly increases sequencing depths, leads to detection of novel peaks that are not otherwise identifiable with uni-reads, and improves detection of peaks in low mappable regions. The computational and experimental results established that multi-reads can be of critical importance for studying DNA-protein interactions in highly repetitive regions of genomes with ChIP-seq experiments. Output from CSEM can be used with other peak callers such as MOSAiCS and MACS to identify peaks that are in both high and low mappable regions of genomes.\n\nPlease cite: Chung D, Kuan PF, Li B, SanalKumar R, Liang K, Bresnick E, Dewey C, and Keles S (2011),\n\"Discovering transcription factor binding sites in highly repetitive regions of genomes\nwith multi-read analysis of ChIP-Seq data,\" PLoS Computational Biology, 7(7): e1002111.\n\n------\n\n**Input formats**\n\nCSEM accepts short reads aligned using bowtie as input. Bowtie accepts single-end reads, in FASTA or FASTQ format, as input. Quality scores of reads are ignored.\n\n------\n\n**Pseudo-tags**\n\nFor each read in the alignment file, CSEM estimates the fraction of the read allocated to each of its alignments. This fraction reflects the degree of confidence in each particular alignment. Currently, only the peak caller MOSAiCS can accept fractional of reads as input. However, you can incorporate multi-reads into ChIP-seq analysis with your favoriate peak-caller by utilizing this pseudo-tag functionality. Pseudo-tags are generated by assigning each multi-read to the location it maps to with the largest weight and filtering out multi-reads with weights less than 0.5. Although summarizing CSEM output as pseudo-tags decreases the number of utilized multi-reads, it still leads to a significant increase in the sequencing depth compared to using uni-reads alone and facilitates identification of  peaks in repetitive regions.\n\n------\n\n**Outputs**\n\nCurrently, results from CSEM can be exported into BED or GFF file formats, or as a table. Each line of the output file specifies a single alignment. The lines of the output file are ordered such that all of the unique read alignments appear first. If pseudo-tags are generated, *FRAC* equals to 1 for all reads if the output is a table and *score* is set to 1000 for all the reads in the BED and GFF formats.\n\nIf the output is a table, it has the following columns::\n\n   Column    Description\n   --------  --------------------------------------------------------\n    1 RID    ID of a read\n    2 CID    Chromosome of the alignment\n    3 DIR    Strand of the alignment (+ or -)\n    4 POS    Left-most position of the aligned read (the first base in a chromosome is numbered 1)\n    5 FRAC   Fraction of the read allocated to the alignment (which is 1 for uni-reads)\n\nIf the output is in BED format, it has the following columns::\n\n    Column        Description\n    ------------  --------------------------------------------------------\n    1 chrom       Chromosome of the alignment\n    2 chromStart  Start position of the aligned read (the first base in a chromosome is numbered 0)\n    3 chromEnd    End position of the aligned read (the first base in a chromosome is numbered 0)\n    4 name        ID of a read\n    5 score       1000 * fraction of the read allocated to the alignment (which is 1000 for uni-reads)\n    6 strand      Strand of the alignment (+ or -)\n\nIf the output is in GFF format, it has the following columns::\n\n    Column     Description\n    ---------  --------------------------------------------------------\n    1 seqname  Chromosome of the alignment\n    2 source   Always \"CSEM\"\n    3 feature  ID of a read\n    4 start    Start position of the aligned read (the first base in a chromosome is numbered 1)\n    5 end      End position of the aligned read (the first base in a chromosome is numbered 1)\n    6 score    1000 * fraction of the read allocated to the alignment (which is 1000 for uni-reads)\n    7 strand   Strand of the alignment (+ or -)\n    8 frame    Always \".\"\n    9 group    Always \".\"\n\n    \n  ","type":"Tool","version":"1.0.1","originLink":"N/A","directLink":"N/A","operatingSystems":[],"programmingLanguages":[],"name":"csem","publisher":"dongjun","id":1852,"parameters":[]}},{"_index":"tools","_type":"tool","_id":"787","_score":0.5673534,"_source":{"outputs":["txt","txt","tabular","tabular","tabular","zip","zip","zip","zip","zip"],"interfaces":[],"methods":[],"inputs":["",""],"author":"","origin":"N/A","domains":[],"description":"\n\n.. class:: infomark\n\n**What it does**\n\nThis program will run each of the Stacks components: first, running ustacks on each of the samples specified, building loci and calling SNPs in each.

The -r option allows only loci that exist in a certain number of population individuals to be exported. In a mapping context, raising or lowering this limit is an effective way to control the quality level of markers exported as genuine markers will be found in a large number of progeny. If exporting a set of observed haplotypes in a population, the \"min stack depth\" option can be used to restict exported loci to those that have a minimum depth of reads.\n\nBy default, when executing the pipeline (either denovo_map or ref_map) the genotypes program will be executed last and will identify mappable markers in the population and export both a set of observed haplotypes and a set of generic genotypes with \"min number of progeny\" option = 1. \n\n\nMaking Corrections\n\nIf enabled with the \"make automated corrections to the data\" option, the genotypes program will make automated corrections to the data. Since loci are matched up in the population, the script can correct false-negative heterozygote alleles since it knows the existence of alleles at a particular locus in the other individuals. For example, the program will identify loci with SNPs that didnâ€™t have high enough coverage to be identified by the SNP caller. It will also check that homozygous tags have a minimum depth of coverage, since a low-coverage polymorphic locus may appear homozygous simply because the other allele wasnâ€™t sequenced.\n\n\nCorrection Thresholds\n\nThe thresholds for automatic corrections can be modified by using the \"automated corrections option\" and changing the default values for the \"min number of reads for homozygous genotype\", \"homozygote minor minimum allele frequency\" and \"heterozygote minor minimum allele frequency\" parameters to genotypes. \"min number of reads for homozygous genotype\" is the minimum number of reads required to consider a stack homozygous (default of 5). The \"homozygote minor minimum allele frequency\" and \"heterozygote minor minimum allele frequency\" variables represent fractions. If the ratio of the depth of the the smaller allele to the bigger allele is greater than \"heterozygote minor minimum allele frequency\" (default of 1/10) a stack is called a het. If the ratio is less than homozygote minor minimum allele frequency (default of 1/20) a stack is called homozygous.

It is written by Bob Harris in Webb Miller's laboratory at Penn State University. Special scoring sets were derived to improve runtime performance and quality. This Galaxy version of LASTZ is geared towards aligning short (Illumina/Solexa, AB/SOLiD) and medium (Roche/454) paired reads against a reference sequence. There is excellent, extensive documentation on LASTZ available here_. \n\n .. _here: http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab/dist/README.lastz-1.02.00/README.lastz-1.02.00.html\n \n------\n\n**Input formats**\n\nLASTZ accepts reference and reads in FASTA format. However, because Galaxy supports implicit format conversion the tool will recognize fastq and other method specific formats.\n\n------\n\n**Outputs**\n\nThis LASTZ tool produces a SAM file showing sequence alignments.\n\n**SAM output**\n\nSAM has 12 columns::\n\n                                   1     2     3         4   5    6  7         8     9                                    10                                     11  12\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  HWI-EAS91_1_30788AAXX:1:2:1670:915    99  chr9  58119878  60  36M  =  58120234   392  GACCCCTACCCCACCGTGCTCTGGATCTCAGTGTTT   IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEIIIIIII7IIIIIIIIIII  XT:A:U  NM:i:0  SM:i:37  AM:i:37  X0:i:1  X1:i:0  XM:i:0  XO:i:0  XG:i:0  MD:Z:36\n  HWI-EAS91_1_30788AAXX:1:2:1670:915   147  chr9  58120234  60  36M  =  58119878  -392  ATGAGTCGAATTCTATTTTCCAAACTGTTAACAAAA   IFIIDI;IIICIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII  XT:A:U  NM:i:0  SM:i:37  AM:i:37  X0:i:1  X1:i:0  XM:i:0  XO:i:0  XG:i:0  MD:Z:36\n\n\nwhere::\n\n     Column  Description\n  ---------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   \n   1.

This is helpful when, for example, you would like to make the reference name compatible with the UCSC naming conventions to be able to display your lastz results as a custom track at the UCSC Genome Browser.\n\n------\n\n**LASTZ parameter list**\n\nThis is an exhaustive list of LASTZ options.

The new alignment is\noutput to stdout in Stockholm format, but can be redirected to a file <f> with the -o <f> option.\nEither <cmfile> or <seqfile> (but not both) may be â€™-â€™ (dash), which means reading this input from stdin rather than a\nfile.\nThe sequence file <seqfile> must be in FASTA or Genbank format.\ncmalign uses an HMM banding technique to accelerate alignment by default as described below for the --hbanded\noption. HMM banding can be turned off with the --nonbanded option.\nBy default, cmalign computes the alignment with maximum expected accuracy that is consistent with constraints\n(bands) derived from an HMM, using a banded version of the Durbin/Holmes optimal accuracy algorithm. This be-\nhavior can be changed with the --cyk or --sample options.\ncmalign takes special care to correctly align truncated sequences, where some nucleotides from the beginning (5â€™)\nand/or end (3â€™) of the actual full length biological sequence are not present in the input sequence (see DL Kolbe and\nSR Eddy, Bioinformatics, 25:1236-1243, 2009). This behavior is on by default, but can be turned off with --notrunc. In\nprevious versions of cmalign the --sub option was required to appropriately handle truncated sequences. The --sub\noption is still available in this version, but the new default method for handling truncated sequences should be as good\nor superior to the sub method in nearly all cases.\nThe --mapali <s> option allows inclusion of the fixed training alignment used to build the CM from file <s> within the\noutput alignment of cmalign.\nIt is possible to merge two or more alignments created by the same CM using the Easel miniapp esl-alimerge (included\nin the easel/miniapps/ subdirectory of Infernal). Previous versions of cmalign included options to merge alignments\nbut they were deprecated upon development of esl-alimerge, which is significantly more memory efficient.\nBy default, cmalign will output the alignment to stdout. The alignment can be redirected to an output file <f> with the\n-o <f> option. With -o, information on each aligned sequence, including score and model alignment boundaries will be\nprinted to stdout (more on this below).\nThe output alignment will be in Stockholm format by default. This can be changed to Pfam, aligned FASTA (AFA), A2M,\nClustal, or Phylip format using the --outformat <s> option, where <s> is the name of the desired format. As a special\ncase, if the output alignment is large (more than 10,000 sequences or more than 10,000,000 total nucleotides) than the\noutput format will be Pfam format, with each sequence appearing on a single line, for reasons of memory efficiency. For\nalignments larger than this, using --ileaved will force interleaved Stockholm format, but the user should be aware that\nthis may require a lot of memory. --ileaved will only work for alignments up to 100,000 sequences or 100,000,000 total\nnucleotides.\nIf the output alignment format is Stockholm or Pfam, the output alignment will be annotated with posterior probabilities\nwhich estimate the confidence level of each aligned nucleotide. This annotation appears as lines beginning with â€�#=GR\n<seq name> PPâ€�, one per sequence, each immediately below the corresponding aligned sequence â€�<seq name>â€�.\nCharacters in PP lines have 12 possible values: â€�0-9â€�, â€�*â€�, or â€�.â€�. If â€�.â€�, the position corresponds to a gap in the sequence.\nA value of â€�0â€� indicates a posterior probability of between 0.0 and 0.05, â€�1â€� indicates between 0.05 and 0.15, â€�2â€�\nindicates between 0.15 and 0.25 and so on up to â€�9â€� which indicates between 0.85 and 0.95. A value of â€�*â€� indicates\na posterior probability of between 0.95 and 1.0. Higher posterior probabilities correspond to greater confidence that\nthe aligned nucleotide belongs where it appears in the alignment. With --nonbanded, the calculation of the posterior\nprobabilities considers all possible alignments of the target sequence to the CM. Without --nonbanded (i.e. in default\nmode), the calculation considers only possible alignments within the HMM bands. Further, the posterior probabilities\nare conditional on the truncation mode of the alignment. For example, if the sequence alignment is truncated 5â€™, a PP\nvalue of â€�9â€� indicates between 0.85 and 0.95 of all 5â€™ truncated alignments include the given nucleotide at the given\nposition. The posterior annotation can be turned off with the --noprob option. If --small is enabled, posterior annotation\nmust also be turned off using --noprob.\nThe tabular output that is printed to stdout if the -o option is used includes one line per sequence and twelve fields\nper line: â€�idxâ€�: the index of the sequence in the input file, â€�seq nameâ€�: the sequence name; â€�lengthâ€�: the length of the\nsequence; â€�cm fromâ€� and â€�cm toâ€�: the model start and end positions of the alignment; â€�truncâ€�: â€�noâ€� if the sequence is\nnot truncated, â€�5â€™â€� if the beginning of the sequence truncated 5â€™, â€�3â€™â€� if the end of the sequence is truncated, and â€�5â€™&3â€™â€�\nif both the beginning and the end are truncated; â€�bit scâ€�: the bit score of the alignment, â€�avg ppâ€� the average posterior\nprobability of all aligned nucleotides in the alignment; â€�band calcâ€�, â€�alignmentâ€� and â€�totalâ€�: the time in seconds required\nfor calculating HMM bands, computing the alignment, and complete processing of the sequence, respectively; â€�mem\n(Mb)â€�: the size in Mb of all dynamic programming matrices required for aligning the sequence. This tabular data can be\nsaved to file <f> with the --sfile <f> option.\n\n\nOptions for controlling the alignment algorithm\n--optacc Align sequences using the Durbin/Holmes optimal accuracy algorithm. This is the default.\nThe optimal accuracy alignment will be constrained by HMM bands for acceleration unless\nthe --nonbanded option is enabled. The optimal accuracy algorithm determines the align-\nment that maximizes the posterior probabilities of the aligned nucleotides within it. The\nposterior probabilites are determined using (possibly HMM banded) variants of the Inside\nand Outside algorithms.\n--cyk Do not use the Durbin/Holmes optimal accuracy alignment to align the sequences, instead\nuse the CYK algorithm which determines the optimally scoring (maximum likelihood) align-\nment of the sequence to the model, given the HMM bands (unless --nonbanded is also\nenabled).\n--sample Sample an alignment from the posterior distribution of alignments. The posterior distribution\nis determined using an HMM banded (unless --nonbanded) variant of the Inside algorithm.\n--seed <n> Seed the random number generator with <n>, an integer >= 0. This option can only be\nused in combination with --sample. If <n> is nonzero, stochastic sampling of alignments\nwill be reproducible; the same command will give the same results. If <n> is 0, the random\nnumber generator is seeded arbitrarily, and stochastic samplings may vary from run to run\nof the same command. The default seed is 181.\n--notrunc Turn off truncated alignment algorithms. All sequences in the input file will be assumed to be\nfull length, unless --sub is also used, in which case the program can still handle truncated\nsequences but will use an alternative strategy for their alignment.\n--sub Turn on the sub model construction and alignment procedure. For each sequence, an HMM\nis first used to predict the model start and end consensus columns, and a new sub CM is\nconstructed that only models consensus columns from start to end. The sequence is then\naligned to this sub CM. Sub alignment is an older method than the default one for aligning\nsequences that are possibly truncated. By default, cmalign uses special DP algorithms to\nhandle truncated sequences which should be more accurate than the sub method in most\ncases. --sub is still included as an option mainly for testing against this default truncated\nsequence handling. This â€�sub CMâ€� procedure is not the same as the â€�sub CMsâ€� described\nby Weinberg and Ruzzo.\n\n\nOther options\n--mapali <f> Reads the alignment from file <f> used to build the model aligns it as a single object to\nthe CM; e.g. the alignment in <f> is held fixed. This allows you to align sequences to a\nmodel with cmalign and view them in the context of an existing trusted multiple alignment.\n<f> must be the alignment file that the CM was built from. The program verifies that the\nchecksum of the file matches that of the file used to construct the CM. A similar option to\nthis one was called --withali in previous versions of cmalign.\n--mapstr Must be used in combination with --mapali <f>. Propogate structural information for any\npseudoknots that exist in <f> to the output alignment. A similar option to this one was called\n--withstr in previous versions of cmalign.\n--informat <s> Assert that the input <seqfile> is in format <s>. Do not run Babelfish format autodec-\ntion. This increases the reliability of the program somewhat, because the Babelfish can\nmake mistakes; particularly recommended for unattended, high-throughput runs of Infernal.\nAcceptable formats are: FASTA, GENBANK, and DDBJ. <s> is case-insensitive.\n--outformat <s> Specify the output alignment format as <s>. Acceptable formats are: Pfam, AFA, A2M,\nClustal, and Phylip. AFA is aligned fasta. Only Pfam and Stockholm alignment formats\nwill include consensus structure annotation and posterior probability annotation of aligned\nresidues.\n--dnaout Output the alignments as DNA sequence alignments, instead of RNA ones.\n--noprob Do not annotate the output alignment with posterior probabilities.\n--matchonly Only include match columns in the output alignment, do not include any insertions relative\nto the consensus model. This option may be useful when creating very large alignments\nthat require a lot of memory and disk space, most of which is necessary only to deal with\ninsert columns that are gaps in most sequences.\n--ileaved Output the alignment in interleaved Stockholm format of a fixed width that may be more con-\nvenient for examination. This was the default output alignment format of previous versions\nof cmalign. Note that cmalign requires more memory when this option is used. For this\nreason, --ileaved will only work for alignments of up to 100,000 sequences or a total of\n100,000,000 aligned nucleotides.\n--regress <s> Save an additional copy of the output alignment with no author information to file <s>.\n--verbose Output additional information in the tabular scores output (output to stdout if -o is used, or\nto <f> if --sfile <f> is used). These are mainly useful for testing and debugging.\n--cpu <n> Specify that <n> parallel CPU workers be used. If <n> is set as â€�0â€�, then the program will\nbe run in serial mode, without using threads. You can also control this number by setting an\nenvironment variable, INFERNAL NCPU. This option will only be available if the machine on\nwhich Infernal was built is capable of using POSIX threading (see the Installation section of\nthe user guide for more information).\n--mpi Run as an MPI parallel program. This option will only be available if Infernal has been\nconfigured and built with the â€�--enable-mpiâ€� flag (see the Installation section of the user\nguide for more information).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput format\n-------------\n\n(1) target name: The name of the target sequence or profile.\n(2) accession: The accession of the target sequence or profile, or â€™-â€™ if none.\n(3) query name: The name of the query sequence or profile.\n(4) accession: The accession of the query sequence or profile, or â€™-â€™ if none.\n(5) mdl (model): Which type of model was used to compute the final score. Either â€™cmâ€™ or â€™hmmâ€™. A CM is used to compute the final hit scores unless the model has zero basepairs or the --hmmonly option is used, in which case a HMM will be used.\n(6) mdl from (model coord): The start of the alignment of this hit with respect to the profile (CM or HMM), numbered 1..N for a profile of N consensus positions.\n(7) mdl to (model coord): The end of the alignment of this hit with respect to the profile (CM or HMM), numbered 1..N for a profile of N consensus positions.\n(8) seq from (ali coord): The start of the alignment of this hit with respect to the sequence, numbered 1..L for a sequence of L residues.\n(9) seq to (ali coord): The end of the alignment of this hit with respect to the sequence, numbered 1..L for a sequence of L residues.\n(10) strand: The strand on which the hit occurs on the sequence. â€™+â€™ if the hit is on the top (Watson) strand, â€™-â€™ if the hit is on the bottom (Crick) strand. If on the top strand, the â€œseq fromâ€� value will be less than or equal to the â€œseq toâ€� value, else it will be greater than or equal to it.\n(11) trunc: Indicates if this is predicted to be a truncated CM hit or not. This will be â€œnoâ€� if it is a CM hit that is not predicted to be truncated by the end of the sequence, â€œ5â€™ â€� or â€œ3â€™ â€� if the hit is predicted to have one or more 5â€™ or 3â€™ residues missing due to a artificial truncation of the sequence, or â€œ5â€™&3â€�â€™ if the hit is predicted to have one or more 5â€™ residues missing and one or more 3â€™ residues missing. If the hit is an HMM hit, this will always be â€™-â€™.\n(12) pass: Indicates what â€œpassâ€� of the pipeline the hit was detected on. This is probably only useful for testing and debugging. Non-truncated hits are found on the first pass, truncated hits are found on successive passes.\n(13) gc: Fraction of G and C nucleotides in the hit.\n(14) bias: The biased-composition correction: the bit score difference contributed by the null3 model for CM hits, or the null2 model for HMM hits. High bias scores may be a red flag for a false positive. It is difficult to correct for all possible ways in which a nonrandom but nonhomologous biological sequences can appear to be similar, such as short-period tandem repeats, so there are cases where the bias correction is not strong enough (creating false positives).\n(15) score: The score (in bits) for this target/query comparison. It includes the biased-composition cor-rection (the â€œnull3â€� model for CM hits, or the â€œnull2â€� model for HMM hits).\n(16) E-value: The expectation value (statistical significance) of the target. This is a per query E-value; i.e. calculated as the expected number of false positives achieving this comparisonâ€™s score for a single query against the search space Z. For cmsearch Z is defined as the total number of nucleotides in the target dataset multiplied by 2 because both strands are searched. For cmscan Z is the total number of nucleotides in the query sequence multiplied by 2 because both strands are searched and multiplied by the number of models in the target database. If you search with multiple queries and if you want to control the overall false positive rate of that search rather than the false positive rate per query, you will want to multiply this per-query E-value by how many queries youâ€™re doing.\n(17) inc: Indicates whether or not this hit achieves the inclusion threshold: â€™!â€™ if it does, â€™?â€™ if it does not (and rather only achieves the reporting threshold). By default, the inclusion threshold is an E-value of 0.01 and the reporting threshold is an E-value of 10.0, but these can be changed with command line options as described in the manual pages.\n(18) description of target: The remainder of the line is the targetâ€™s description line, as free text.\n\n\nFor further questions please refere to the Infernal Userguide_.\n\n.. _Userguide: http://selab.janelia.org/software/infernal/Userguide.pdf\n\n\nHow do I cite Infernal?\n-----------------------\n\nThe recommended citation for using Infernal 1.1 is E.

Bismark takes in FastA or FastQ files and aligns the\nreads to a specified bisulfite genome. Sequence reads are transformed into a bisulfite converted forward strand\nversion (C->T conversion) or into a bisulfite treated reverse strand (G->A conversion of the forward strand).\nEach of these reads are then aligned to bisulfite treated forward strand index of a reference genome\n(C->T converted) and a bisulfite treated reverse strand index of the genome (G->A conversion of the\nforward strand, by doing this alignments will produce the same positions). These instances of Bowtie 2\nare run in parallel. The sequence file(s) are then read in again sequence by sequence to pull out the original\nsequence from the genome and determine if there were any protected C's present or not.\n\n.. _Bismark: http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/\n\nAs of version 0.7.0 Bismark will only run 2 alignment threads for OT and OB in parallel, the 4 strand mode can be\nre-enabled by using non_directional mode.\n\nIt is developed by Krueger F and Andrews SR. at the Babraham Institute.

It is all like stick-shift driving in San Francisco. In other words = running this tool with default parameters will probably not give you meaningful results. A way to deal with this is to **understand** the parameters by carefully reading the `documentation`__ and experimenting. Fortunately, Galaxy makes experimenting easy.\n\n .. __: http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/\n\n\n.. class:: warningmark\n\nMake sure all your input reads are in the correct and same format. If thats not the case please adjust/convert the filetype with galaxy's build-in converters.\n\n------\n\n**Input formats**\n\nBismark accepts files in either Sanger FASTQ format (galaxy type *fastqsanger*), Illumina FASTQ format (galaxy type *fastqillumina*) or FASTA format (galaxy type *fasta*). Use the FASTQ Groomer to prepare your files.\n\n------\n\n**A Note on Built-in Reference Genomes**\n\nThe default variant for all genomes is \"Full\", defined as all primary chromosomes (or scaffolds/contigs) including mitochondrial plus associated unmapped, plasmid, and other segments. When only one version of a genome is available in this tool, it represents the default \"Full\" variant. Some genomes will have more than one variant available. The \"Canonical Male\" or sometimes simply \"Canonical\" variant contains the primary chromosomes for a genome. For example a human \"Canonical\" variant contains chr1-chr22, chrX, chrY, and chrM. The \"Canonical Female\" variant contains the primary chromosomes excluding chrY.\n\n------\n\nThe final output of Bismark is in SAM format by default.\n\n**Outputs**\n\nThe output is in SAM format, and has the following columns::\n\n    Column  Description\n  --------  --------------------------------------------------------\n  1  QNAME  seq-ID\n  2  FLAG   this flag tries to take the strand a bisulfite read\n            originated from into account\n            (this is different from ordinary DNA alignment flags!)\n  3  RNAME  chromosome\n  4  POS    start position\n  5  MAPQ   always 255\n  6  CIGAR  extended CIGAR string\n  7  MRNM   Mate Reference sequence NaMe ('=' if same as RNAME)\n  8  MPOS   1-based Mate POSition\n  9  ISIZE  Inferred insert SIZE\n  10 SEQ    query SEQuence on the same strand as the reference\n  11 QUAL   Phred33 scale\n  12 NM-tag edit distance to the reference)\n  13 XX-tag base-by-base mismatches to the reference.\n            This does not include indels.\n  14 XM-tag methylation call string\n  15 XR-tag read conversion state for the alignment\n  16 XG-tag genome conversion state for the alignment\n\n\nEach read of paired-end alignments is written out in a separate line in the above format.\n\n\nIt looks like this (scroll sideways to see the entire example)::\n\n  QNAME\tFLAG\tRNAME\tPOS\tMAPQ\tCIAGR\tMRNM\tMPOS\tISIZE\tSEQ\tQUAL\tOPT\n  HWI-EAS91_1_30788AAXX:1:1:1761:343\t4\t*\t0\t0\t*\t*\t0\t0\tAAAAAAANNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACNNANNGAGTNGNNNNNNNGCTTCCCACAGNNCTGG\thhhhhhh;;hhhhhhhhhhh^hOhhhhghhhfhhhgh;;h;;hhhh;h;;;;;;;hhhhhhghhhh;;Phhh\n  HWI-EAS91_1_30788AAXX:1:1:1578:331\t4\t*\t0\t0\t*\t*\t0\t0\tGTATAGANNAATAAGAAAAAAAAAAATGAAGACTTTCNNANNTCTGNANNNNNNNTCTTTTTTCAGNNGTAG\thhhhhhh;;hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh;;h;;hhhh;h;;;;;;;hhhhhhhhhhh;;hhVh\n\n-------\n\n**Bismark settings**\n\nAll of the options have a default value. You can change any of them. If any Bismark function is missing please contact the tool author or your Galaxy admin.\n\n------\n\n**Bismark parameter list**\n\nThis is an exhaustive list of Bismark options.\n\nInput::\n\n  --singles              A comma- or space-separated list of files containing the reads to be aligned (e.g.\n                         lane1.fq,lane2.fq lane3.fq). Reads may be a mix of different lengths. Bismark will\n                         produce one mapping result and one report file per input file.\n\n  -1 mates1              Comma-separated list of files containing the #1 mates (filename usually includes\n                         \"_1\"), e.g. flyA_1.fq,flyB_1.fq). Sequences specified with this option must\n                         correspond file-for-file and read-for-read with those specified in mates2.\n                         Reads may be a mix of different lengths. Bismark will produce one mapping result\n                         and one report file per paired-end input file pair.\n\n  -2 mates2              Comma-separated list of files containing the #2 mates (filename usually includes\n                         \"_2\"), e.g. flyA_1.fq,flyB_1.fq). Sequences specified with this option must\n                         correspond file-for-file and read-for-read with those specified in mates1.\n                         Reads may be a mix of different lengths.\n\n  -q/--fastq             The query input files (specified as mate1,mate2 or singles are FASTQ\n                         files (usually having extension .fg or .fastq). This is the default. See also\n                         --solexa-quals.\n\n  -f/--fasta             The query input files (specified as mate1,mate2 or singles are FASTA\n                         files (usually havin extension .fa, .mfa, .fna or similar). All quality values\n                         are assumed to be 40 on the Phred scale.\n\n  -s/--skip INT          Skip (i.e. do not align) the first INT reads or read pairs from the input.\n\n  -u/--upto INT          Only aligns the first INT reads or read pairs from the input. Default: no limit.\n\n  --phred33-quals        FASTQ qualities are ASCII chars equal to the Phred quality plus 33. Default: on.\n\n  --phred64-quals        FASTQ qualities are ASCII chars equal to the Phred quality plus 64. Default: off.\n\n  --solexa-quals         Convert FASTQ qualities from solexa-scaled (which can be negative) to phred-scaled\n                         (which can't). The formula for conversion is:\n                         phred-qual = 10 * log(1 + 10 ** (solexa-qual/10.0)) / log(10). Used with -q. This\n                         is usually the right option for use with (unconverted) reads emitted by the GA\n                         Pipeline versions prior to 1.3. Works only for Bowtie 1. Default: off.\n\n  --solexa1.3-quals      Same as --phred64-quals. This is usually the right option for use with (unconverted)\n                         reads emitted by GA Pipeline version 1.3 or later. Default: off.\n\n\nAlignment::\n\n  -n/--seedmms INT       The maximum number of mismatches permitted in the \"seed\", i.e. the first L base pairs\n                         of the read (where L is set with -l/--seedlen). This may be 0, 1, 2 or 3 and the\n                         default is 1. This option is only available for Bowtie 1 (for Bowtie 2 see -N).\n\n  -l/--seedlen           The \"seed length\"; i.e., the number of bases of the high quality end of the read to\n                         which the -n ceiling applies. The default is 28. Bowtie (and thus Bismark) is faster for\n                         larger values of -l. This option is only available for Bowtie 1 (for Bowtie 2 see -L).\n\n  -e/--maqerr INT        Maximum permitted total of quality values at all mismatched read positions throughout\n                         the entire alignment, not just in the \"seed\". The default is 70. Like Maq, bowtie rounds\n                         quality values to the nearest 10 and saturates at 30. This value is not relevant for\n                         Bowtie 2.\n\n  --chunkmbs INT         The number of megabytes of memory a given thread is given to store path descriptors in\n                         --best mode. Best-first search must keep track of many paths at once to ensure it is\n                         always extending the path with the lowest cumulative cost. Bowtie tries to minimize the\n                         memory impact of the descriptors, but they can still grow very large in some cases. If\n                         you receive an error message saying that chunk memory has been exhausted in --best mode,\n                         try adjusting this parameter up to dedicate more memory to the descriptors. This value\n                         is not relevant for Bowtie 2. Default: 512.\n\n  -I/--minins INT        The minimum insert size for valid paired-end alignments. E.g. if -I 60 is specified and\n                         a paired-end alignment consists of two 20-bp alignments in the appropriate orientation\n                         with a 20-bp gap between them, that alignment is considered valid (as long as -X is also\n                         satisfied). A 19-bp gap would not be valid in that case. Default: 0.\n\n  -X/--maxins INT        The maximum insert size for valid paired-end alignments. E.g. if -X 100 is specified and\n                         a paired-end alignment consists of two 20-bp alignments in the proper orientation with a\n                         60-bp gap between them, that alignment is considered valid (as long as -I is also satisfied).\n                         A 61-bp gap would not be valid in that case. Default: 500.\n\n\n\nOutput::\n\n  --non_directional      The sequencing library was constructed in a non strand-specific manner, alignments to all four\n                         bisulfite strands will be reported. Default: OFF.\n\n                         (The current Illumina protocol for BS-Seq is directional, in which case the strands complementary\n                         to the original strands are merely theoretical and should not exist in reality. Specifying directional\n                         alignments (which is the default) will only run 2 alignment threads to the original top (OT)\n                         or bottom (OB) strands in parallel and report these alignments. This is the recommended option\n                         for sprand-specific libraries).\n\n  --sam-no-hd            Suppress SAM header lines (starting with @). This might be useful when very large input files are\n                         split up into several smaller files to run concurrently and the output files are to be merged.\n\n  --quiet                Print nothing besides alignments.\n\n  --vanilla              Performs bisulfite mapping with Bowtie 1 and prints the 'old' output (as in Bismark 0.5.X) instead\n                         of SAM format output.\n\n  -un/--unmapped         Write all reads that could not be aligned to a file in the output directory. Written reads will\n                         appear as they did in the input, without any translation of quality values that may have\n                         taken place within Bowtie or Bismark. Paired-end reads will be written to two parallel files with _1\n                         and _2 inserted in their filenames, i.e. _unmapped_reads_1.txt and unmapped_reads_2.txt. Reads\n                         with more than one valid alignment with the same number of lowest mismatches (ambiguous mapping)\n                         are also written to _unmapped_reads.txt unless the option --ambiguous is specified as well.\n\n  --ambiguous            Write all reads which produce more than one valid alignment with the same number of lowest\n                         mismatches or other reads that fail to align uniquely to a file in the output directory.\n                         Written reads will appear as they did in the input, without any of the translation of quality\n                         values that may have taken place within Bowtie or Bismark. Paired-end reads will be written to two\n                         parallel files with _1 and _2 inserted in theit filenames, i.e. _ambiguous_reads_1.txt and\n                         _ambiguous_reads_2.txt. These reads are not written to the file specified with --un.\n\n  -o/--output_dir DIR    Write all output files into this directory. By default the output files will be written into\n                         the same folder as the input file(s). If the specified folder does not exist, Bismark will attempt\n                         to create it first. The path to the output folder can be either relative or absolute.\n\n  --temp_dir DIR          Write temporary files to this directory instead of into the same directory as the input files. If\n                         the specified folder does not exist, Bismark will attempt to create it first. The path to the\n                         temporary folder can be either relative or absolute.\n\n------\n\nBowtie 2 alignment options::\n\n  -N INT                 Sets the number of mismatches to allowed in a seed alignment during multiseed alignment.\n                         Can be set to 0 or 1. Setting this higher makes alignment slower (often much slower)\n                         but increases sensitivity. Default: 0. This option is only available for Bowtie 2 (for\n                         Bowtie 1 see -n).\n\n  -L INT                   Sets the length of the seed substrings to align during multiseed alignment. Smaller values\n                         make alignment slower but more senstive. Default: the --sensitive preset of Bowtie 2 is\n                         used by default, which sets -L to 20. This option is only available for Bowtie 2 (for\n                         Bowtie 1 see -l).\n\n  --ignore-quals         When calculating a mismatch penalty, always consider the quality value at the mismatched\n                         position to be the highest possible, regardless of the actual value. I.e. input is treated\n                         as though all quality values are high. This is also the default behavior when the input\n                         doesn't specify quality values (e.g. in -f mode). This option is invariable and on by default.\n\n\nBowtie 2 paired-end options::\n\n  --no-mixed             This option disables Bowtie 2's behavior to try to find alignments for the individual mates if\n                         it cannot find a concordant or discordant alignment for a pair. This option is invariable and\n                         and on by default.\n\n  --no-discordant        Normally, Bowtie 2 looks for discordant alignments if it cannot find any concordant alignments.\n                         A discordant alignment is an alignment where both mates align uniquely, but that does not\n                         satisfy the paired-end constraints (--fr/--rf/--ff, -I, -X). This option disables that behavior\n                         and it is on by default.\n\n\nBowtie 2 effort options::\n\n  -D INT                 Up to INT consecutive seed extension attempts can \"fail\" before Bowtie 2 moves on, using\n                         the alignments found so far. A seed extension \"fails\" if it does not yield a new best or a\n                         new second-best alignment. Default: 15.\n\n  -R INT                 INT is the maximum number of times Bowtie 2 will \"re-seed\" reads with repetitive seeds.\n                         When \"re-seeding,\" Bowtie 2 simply chooses a new set of reads (same length, same number of\n                         mismatches allowed) at different offsets and searches for more alignments. A read is considered\n                         to have repetitive seeds if the total number of seed hits divided by the number of seeds\n                         that aligned at least once is greater than 300. Default: 2.\n\n\nBowtie 2 Scoring options::\n\n  --score_min \"func\"     Sets a function governing the minimum alignment score needed for an alignment to be considered\n                         \"valid\" (i.e. good enough to report). This is a function of read length. For instance, specifying\n                         L,0,-0.2 sets the minimum-score function f to f(x) = 0 + -0.2 * x, where x is the read length.\n                         See also: setting function options at http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2. The default is\n                         L,0,-0.2.\n\n\nBowtie 2 Reporting options::\n\n --most_valid_alignments INT This used to be the Bowtie 2 parameter -M. As of Bowtie 2 version 2.0.0 beta7 the option -M is\n                         deprecated. It will be removed in subsequent versions. What used to be called -M mode is still the\n                         default mode, but adjusting the -M setting is deprecated.  Use the -D and -R options to adjust the\n                         effort expended to find valid alignments.\n\n                         For reference, this used to be the old (now deprecated) description of -M:\n                         Bowtie 2 searches for at most INT+1 distinct, valid alignments for each read. The search terminates when it\n                         can't find more distinct valid alignments, or when it finds INT+1 distinct alignments, whichever\n                         happens first. Only the best alignment is reported. Information from the other alignments is used to\n                         estimate mapping quality and to set SAM optional fields, such as AS:i and XS:i. Increasing -M makes\n                         Bowtie 2 slower, but increases the likelihood that it will pick the correct alignment for a read that\n                         aligns many places. For reads that have more than INT+1 distinct, valid alignments, Bowtie 2 does not\n                         guarantee that the alignment reported is the best possible in terms of alignment score. -M is\n                         always used and its default value is set to 10.\n\n\n  ","type":"Tool","version":"0.10.2","originLink":"N/A","directLink":"N/A","operatingSystems":[],"programmingLanguages":[],"name":"bismark_bowtie2","publisher":"bgruening","id":1760,"parameters":[]}}]}}
